# Requirements

The documentation is generated in Python (both 2 and 3 version are tested by Travis CI).

Before starting, execute the following commands:

* 1 - Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install the following Python packages:

```shell
$ pip install sphinx pygments sphinxcontrib-inlinesyntaxhighlight
```

 * 2 - Install Lexers:

 ```shell
$ make install-lexer
$ make install-lexer-balzac
 ```
 
# Building

 * 1 - Build your own documentation:
 
 ```shell
 $ make build-doc
 ```

 * 2 - Start a local web server:

 ```shell
$ make server
 ```

 Browse to **localhost:8000** to check your documentation.
