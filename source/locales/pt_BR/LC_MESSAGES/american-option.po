"An *option* is a financial contract that allows an investor to exercise a"
" choice between two subcontracts. We implement in BitML the *American "
"option*, where the investor can exercise the choice anytime before a "

"We start by defining the parametric contract :bitml:`(AmericanOption Part"
" t Contract1 Contract2 Default)`. The parameter of the contract are: a "
"participant ``Part`` who can choose, before deadline ``t``, to authorise "
"the either ``Contract1`` or ``Contract2``. If time ``t`` passes, the "
"contract can proceed as the parameter contract ``Default``."

"We exploit the American Option to implement an investment contract "
"between an investor ``A`` and an issuer ``I``. After stipulating the "
"contract, ``A`` can choose whether to invest, or to retract. If she "
"authorise the contract ``Invest``, she immediately pays her 1 BTC deposit"
" to ``I``, expecting to get back 1.1 BTC from ``I`` after block "
"160000000. If she authorise the contract ``Retract``, she does not "
"invest, but she only gets back 0.95 BTC, paying 0.05 BTC to ``I`` as a "
"fee. Otherwise, if she doesn't chose before the deadline ``t`` , ``I`` "
"can invoke the contract ``Default``, which returns ``A``'s deposit to "
"her, minus a 0.1 BTC penalty, which goes to ``I``."
