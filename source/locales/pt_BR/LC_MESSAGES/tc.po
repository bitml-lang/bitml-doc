"Assume that Alice wants to choose a secret ``s``, and reveal it after "
"some time -- while guaranteeing that the revealed value corresponds to "
"the chosen secret (or paying a penalty otherwise). This can be obtained "
"through a timed commitment, a protocol with applications e.g. in gambling"
" games, where the secret contains the player move, and the delay in the "
"revelation of the secret is intended to prevent other players from "
"altering the outcome of the game."

"In the timed commitment below, Alice commits a secret of hash "
"``b472a266d0bd89c13706a4132ccfb16f7c3b9fcb``, and has until block 1550000"
" to reveal it. After block 1550000 is appended to the blockchain, Bob can"
" redeem Alice's deposit."

"Alice opens the `Balzac Online Editor <https://editor.balzac-"
"lang.xyz/>`_, and pastes the output of the compiler. She starts computing"
" her signatures, by first defining her public key ``privA``, then putting"
" :balzac:`sig(privA)` where the compiler requires her signatures. She "
"also puts the value of her secret ``00000000...001``."

"Then, she evaluates her signatures, using :balzac:`eval sig(privA) of "
"Tinit@0, ...` at the bottom of the file, and sends them to Bob. Bob does "
"the same, so Alice receives his signatures and puts them in the constant "
"declarations ``sigBT1``, ``sigBT3``, ``sigBT3``."

"Now all the transactions are completed and Alice can evaluate them, and "

"After ``T1`` added to the blockchain, is not possible to publish ``T3`` "
"(the transaction that send Alice's deposit to Bob) anymore, because they "
"spend the same output ``Tinit@0``. This is coherent with the "
"specification of the contract, because if Alice reveals her secret, Bob "
"shouldn't be able to take her deposit."
